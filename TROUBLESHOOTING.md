# Troubleshooting

Common errors and how to fix them.

---

## 401 — `NotAuthenticated: Failed to verify the HTTP(S) Signature`

**Cause:** The OCI API private key path, fingerprint, or tenancy OCID in `oci_config` is wrong.

**Fix checklist:**
1. Open `oci_config` and confirm the `key_file` path is the **absolute** path to your `.pem` file.
2. Run `ls -la <key_file_path>` — the file must exist and be readable by the current user.
3. Confirm the `fingerprint` matches what OCI shows under your profile > API Keys.
4. Confirm `tenancy` and `user` OCIDs are correct — they look like `ocid1.tenancy.oc1..xxxxx`.
5. Check your system clock: OCI signatures expire if your clock is more than 5 minutes off. Run `date` and compare with world time.

## 400 — `LimitExceeded`

**Cause:** Your tenancy has hit a resource quota — either the ARM instance already exists, or boot volume storage is exhausted.

**Fix checklist:**
1. Log into the [OCI Console](https://cloud.oracle.com) → Compute → Instances. Check if an ARM instance already exists.
2. If it does, the script should detect it and stop. If it already stopped, check `INSTANCE_CREATED`.
3. If no instance exists, go to **Governance → Limits, Quotas and Usage** and look at `Block Volume` and `Compute` limits.
4. Delete unused boot volumes to free up storage if needed.

## `No logs after 60 seconds` / `Couldn't find any logs`

**Cause:** Python crashed before it could write `launch_instance.log`.

**Fix:**
1. Check `python_error.log` in the project directory — it captures Python startup errors since the fix in [#83](https://github.com/mohankumarpaluru/oracle-freetier-instance-creation/pull/83).
2. Common causes: wrong Python version, missing dependencies, or bad `oci.env` values.
3. Run `python3 main.py` directly to see the error in your terminal.
4. Re-run setup: `./setup_init.sh` (not `rerun`) to reinstall dependencies.

## `Connection aborted` / `MaxRetryError` / `503`

**Cause:** Transient network issue or OCI API outage.

**This is handled automatically.** Since [#83](https://github.com/mohankumarpaluru/oracle-freetier-instance-creation/pull/83), connection errors and 503s are treated as retryable. The script will wait `REQUEST_WAIT_TIME_SECS` and try again. If the error is persistent (hours), check the [OCI Status page](https://ocistatus.oraclecloud.com/).

## 404 — `NotAuthorizedOrNotFound`

**Cause:** The API key doesn't have permission to access the resource, or a resource OCID is wrong.

**Fix checklist:**
1. Confirm the IAM policy for your user allows `manage` on `instances` and `vnics` in your compartment.
2. If you set `OCI_SUBNET_ID` manually, verify it is the correct OCID for your tenancy.
3. Confirm `OCI_CONFIG` points to a config file where `tenancy` matches your actual tenancy OCID.

## SSH — `Permission denied (publickey)` after instance creation

**Cause:** Using the wrong key file when connecting.

The script generates a **key pair**: a private key (e.g. `id_rsa_private`) and a public key (`id_rsa.pub`). To SSH in you must use the **private** key:

```bash
# Wrong:
ssh -i id_rsa.pub ubuntu@<ip>

# Correct:
ssh -i id_rsa_private ubuntu@<ip>
```

Also confirm you have assigned a public IP to the instance in the OCI console (Compute → Instances → your instance → Attached VNICs → Edit → Add Public IP).

## Account suspension / service limits zeroed out

A small number of users have reported that their Oracle Free Tier service limits were reduced to zero after running automation scripts like this one for extended periods. I have not personally experienced this, and it has not been a widespread pattern in the community — but it is worth being aware of.

**What likely happens:** Oracle's backend monitoring may flag tenancies that generate unusually high API call volumes over time. The OCI API Terms of Service permit programmatic access, including instance provisioning, but Oracle retains the right to take action on accounts that are flagged.

**What this script does by default:**
- Makes one API call every `REQUEST_WAIT_TIME_SECS` seconds (default: 60 seconds).
- At the default rate that is ~1,440 API calls per day — broadly comparable to other provisioning tools.

**Recommendations for responsible use:**
- Keep `REQUEST_WAIT_TIME_SECS` at **60 or above**. There is no meaningful benefit to going lower, and it increases API call volume.
- Avoid restarting the script repeatedly in quick succession — each startup triggers an immediate launch attempt before the timer kicks in.
- Once your instance is successfully created, stop the script. It exits automatically on success, but check `INSTANCE_CREATED` to confirm.

If your limits have already been reduced, contact [Oracle Cloud Support](https://support.oracle.com) directly — this is an account policy matter that can only be resolved with Oracle.

## `oci.env: line N: <word>: command not found`

**Cause:** A value in `oci.env` contains spaces and isn't quoted (e.g. `OPERATING_SYSTEM=Canonical Ubuntu`). Bash tries to execute the second word as a command.

**Fix:** Open `oci.env` and put double quotes around any value with spaces:
```bash
OPERATING_SYSTEM="Canonical Ubuntu"
DISPLAY_NAME="my arm instance"
```

If you used `setup_env.sh` to generate the file, re-run it — this quoting issue was fixed in the script.
